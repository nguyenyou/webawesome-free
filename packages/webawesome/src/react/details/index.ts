/**
 * @summary Details show a brief summary and expand to show additional content.
 * @documentation https://backers.webawesome.com/docs/components/details
 * @status stable
 * @since 2.0
 *
 * @dependency wa-icon
 *
 * @slot - The details' main content.
 * @slot summary - The details' summary. Alternatively, you can use the `summary` attribute.
 * @slot expand-icon - Optional expand icon to use instead of the default. Works best with `<wa-icon>`.
 * @slot collapse-icon - Optional collapse icon to use instead of the default. Works best with `<wa-icon>`.
 *
 * @event wa-show - Emitted when the details opens.
 * @event wa-after-show - Emitted after the details opens and all animations are complete.
 * @event wa-hide - Emitted when the details closes.
 * @event wa-after-hide - Emitted after the details closes and all animations are complete.
 *
 * @csspart base - The inner `<details>` element used to render the component.
 *                 Styles you apply to the component are automatically applied to this part, so you usually don't need to deal with it unless you need to set the `display` property.
 * @csspart header - The header that wraps both the summary and the expand/collapse icon.
 * @csspart summary - The container that wraps the summary.
 * @csspart icon - The container that wraps the expand/collapse icons.
 * @csspart content - The details content.
 *
 * @cssproperty --spacing - The amount of space around and between the details' content. Expects a single value.
 * @cssproperty [--show-duration=200ms] - The show duration to use when applying built-in animation classes.
 * @cssproperty [--hide-duration=200ms] - The hide duration to use when applying built-in animation classes.
