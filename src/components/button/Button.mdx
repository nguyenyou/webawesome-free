# Button
 
Buttons are used to trigger actions.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Examples

### Variants

Use the `variant` attribute to set the button's semantic variant.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Variants} />

### Appearance

Use the `appearance` attribute to change the button's visual appearance.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Appearances} />

### Sizes

Use the `size` attribute to change a button's size.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Sizes} />

### Pill Buttons

Use the `pill` attribute to give buttons rounded edges.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Pill} />

### Link Buttons

It's often helpful to have a button that works like a link. This is possible by setting the `href` attribute, which will make the component render an `<a>` under the hood. This gives you all the default link behavior the browser provides (e.g. [[CMD/CTRL/SHIFT]] + [[CLICK]]) and exposes the `rel`, `target`, and `download` attributes.

### Icon Buttons

When only an [icon](/docs/components/icon) is slotted into the `label` slot, the button becomes an icon button. In this case, it's important to give the icon a label for users with assistive devices. Icon buttons can use any appearance or variant.

### Setting a Custom Width

As expected, buttons can be given a custom width by setting the `width` CSS property. This is useful for making buttons span the full width of their container on smaller screens.

### Start & End Decorations

Use the `start` and `end` slots to add presentational elements like `<wa-icon>` next to the button label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.StartEndDecorations} />

### Caret

Use the `with-caret` attribute to add a dropdown indicator when a button will trigger a dropdown, menu, or popover.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Caret} />

### Loading

Use the `loading` attribute to make a button busy. The width will remain the same as before, preventing adjacent elements from moving around.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` attribute to disable a button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Styling Buttons

This example demonstrates how to style buttons using a custom class. This is the recommended approach if you need to add additional variations. To customize an existing variation, modify the selector to target the button's `variant` attribute instead of a class (e.g. `wa-button[variant="brand"]`).
